    Fourier-Domain Acceleration and Jerk Search Routine
                    by Scott M. Ransom

Analyzing Mystery_PSR data from 'Sband_DM0.00.fft'.

Memory mapping the input FFT.  This may take a while...
Normalizing powers using median-blocks (default).

Full f-fdot plane would need 0.00 GB: using in-memory accelsearch.

Searching with up to 8 harmonics summed:
  f = 1.0 to 6944.4 Hz
  r = 38.0 to 265499.0 Fourier bins
  z = 0.0 to 0.0 Fourier bins drifted

Generating correlation kernels:
  Harm  1/1 :     1 kernels,    0 < z < 0    (2048 pt FFTs)
Total RAM used by correlation kernels:  0.000 GB
Done generating kernels.

Analyzing Mystery_PSR data from 'Sband_DM17.00.fft'.

Memory mapping the input FFT.  This may take a while...
Normalizing powers using median-blocks (default).

Full f-fdot plane would need 0.00 GB: using in-memory accelsearch.

Searching with up to 8 harmonics summed:
  f = 1.0 to 6944.4 Hz
  r = 38.0 to 265499.0 Fourier bins
  z = 0.0 to 0.0 Fourier bins drifted

Generating correlation kernels:
  Harm  1/1 :     1 kernels,    0 < z < 0    (2048 pt FFTs)
Total RAM used by correlation kernels:  0.000 GB
Done generating kernels.
